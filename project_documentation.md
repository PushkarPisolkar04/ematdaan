- Interactive result visualization

#### 2.4 Role-based Access Control
- Voter registration and verification
- Administrative dashboard
- Public vote verification portal

## Process Flow

### 1. User Registration Flow
The user registration process follows these steps:
1. User initiates registration
2. Connects MetaMask wallet
3. Verifies email address
4. Sets up two-factor authentication
5. Completes identity verification
6. Registration is finalized

### 2. Voting Process Flow
The voting process includes:
1. User logs in with credentials
2. System verifies identity
3. User accesses digital ballot
4. Vote is encrypted and cast
5. System generates vote receipt
6. Vote is verified through Merkle tree
7. User receives confirmation

### 3. Vote Verification Flow
The verification process consists of:
1. Vote submission
2. Vote encryption
3. Merkle proof generation
4. Database storage
5. Receipt issuance
6. Public portal verification

## Use Cases
